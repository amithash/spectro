				SPECTRO
===============================================================================

Description:
------------

Spectro is a collection of tools which in the end aid in listening to music
similar to an initially predetermined song name. Usage of each tool is provided

Install:
-------
In the root directory, 
./configure.sh
make
sudo make install
# or make install # as root

Uninstall
---------
sudo make uninstall
# or make uninstall # as root

Requirements
------------

I cannot right now, describe what all are required. I can state the basic minimum
required to compile the package:
0. Compilers - gcc, g++, make
1. gstreamer and its development libs.
2. mp3 support in gstreamer (This is usually in the bad and ugly libs) = If you want mp3s
3. Qt 4.7 development libs. (Including qmake)
4. Anything else configure complains about :-)
5. TagLib for the utils.


===============================================================================
		Steps to perform before using spectradio
===============================================================================

Usage:
------

1. Generate "spect" files for your MP3 collection.
	run gen_spectro.sh from the directory containing your music collection.

	********** NOTE ********
	This is a _very_ _very_ heavy and time consuming step. For my 8000 song
	collection, it takes ~7 hours on a dual core machine. This is best done
	before bed time and if on a laptop = connect the damn charger!

	It generates files which are 192KB per song (Song duration does not matter).
	So make sure you have disk space. (For 8000 tracks the total space = 1.5 GB)

2. Generate the spect file list.
	find /full/path/to/your/music/collection -name *.spect > filelist.txt
	This step generates a file list.

3. Generate the sdb file.
	genspectdb /path/to/file/created/in/step/2/filelist.txt /path/to/place/out.sdb

	**** NOTE ****
	This consumes some time. It takes about 10 minutes for 8000 spect files.
	The out file is <Num Mp3> * 193kB ~ 1.5 GB for 8000 tracks.

4. Generate the hdb file.
	spect2hist /path/to/file.sdb /path/to/output/file.hdb

	This is quite quick, and the generated .hdb is also quite small. ~100MB for 8000 tracks.

Notes:
	After step 4, you can delete the sdb file. 

Updating collection:
--------------------

In case you add more tracks to your collection,

Repeat all the above steps. 
Step 1 wont take as long, as it generates the spect files only for the newly added files.
So updating collection should get over within 10-20 minutes.

Freeing up space:
-----------------

If you decide to delete all the generated spect files:
	find /path/to/Music/Collection -name *.spect -exec rm -f {} \;

*But be warned*, if you want to update your collection, Step 1 will end up taking 
the same time. 

===============================================================================
				Using spectradio
===============================================================================

1. Start up spectradio,
2. File->Load DB
3. Browse and select your .hdb file.
4. This will take some time to load the db. 
5. From here on, you can select a song you want to listen to, then spectradio
   will pick songs similar to that on. (Like pandora, with your own collection).


===============================================================================
			Known Issues or Annoyances 
===============================================================================
spectradio does not show file paths in case tags are not set on the file.

spectrogen == moodbar
---------------------
spectrogen is a line by line copy of moodbar 0.1.2. In fact the *.spect files
are just glorified .mood files. So, mood files are 1000 elements in length,
and has information of 3 bands (Used for R, G & B colors). Spect is 8192 in
length, and has 24 bands (Essentially the maximum). 

A simple diff of moodbar source with spectrogen, will provide you will a lot
of lines changed, but if you observe closely, I had to rename a few things
so that the filters do not interfere with moodbar (If it also exists).

spectradio == Qt Music player example + My crap
-----------------------------------------------

You will notice that not a pixel has changed from that! :-)

I have added to that in the most hackiest way possible (Since my native
language is not C++, it is C and I have absolutely no experience writing
GUI programs).
