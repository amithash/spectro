This has minor changes from the moodbar plugin. 
Since the generated file is not compatible to that of moodbar's users
I had to change all references to moodbar with that of spectgen....
(Just so that I do not piss off people :-)  who use moodbar and wants
to see what the f**k this tool is all about)
